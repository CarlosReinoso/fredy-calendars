0. if it weren't for jarrod overson's [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJbZGfomrHtwpdjrARoMVaA/search?query=Puppeteer), i might've probably not gotten the courage to start working with puppeteer.
1. props to the original idea via [pptraas.com](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/pptraas.com) â€” although, i like my current domain name just the same ;)
2. huge thanks to [Salma | @whitep4nth3r](https://twitter.com/whitep4nth3r) for sharing insights on the [puppeteer <> vercel](https://www.contentful.com/blog/2021/03/17/puppeteer-node-open-graph-screenshot-for-socials/) blog post.
